To-Do:
    Finish the Raw Vibranium Block (add world generation)
        recode tick function to decrease lag and remove milk loophole
    Recode ModBlocks and ModEffects so item properties and effect properties can be defined in their respective classes
    add vibranium decay and sickness texture
    made vibranium sickness turn your hunger bar purple
    make vibranium decay turn your hearts black (like wither effect)
    Add the Black Panther Fruit (permanently increases strength, speed, jump height, and health.)
        if fruit not eaten, armor and tools gives vibranium decay
