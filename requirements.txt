To-Do:
    * Fix BlackPantherPowerCapabilities
        add enhanced jump height to panther power
        fix balancing on attribute modifiers
        make sure all attribute modifiers are actually taking effect
        some attributes are reset upon rejoining world but not power capability data
    create feature list (list of everything in the mod for documentation)
    Add world gen for Raw Vibranium Block
    add vibranium decay and sickness texture
    add potions for decay and sickness and add brewing stand recipe for them
    make vibranium sickness turn your hunger bar purple
    make vibranium decay turn your hearts black and hunger bar purple
    make it so milk doesn't remove vibranium sickness and decay
    add new item that cures you of vibranium decay
    Finish the Black Panther Fruit
        add texture for unactivated and activated fruit
        unactivated must be crafted with something to make the activated fruit
        fruit makes you immune to sickness and decay
        fruit makes your hearts purple
    make garden structure where dormant fruit generates (maybe add a boss here?)
    Add new workstation to process raw vibranium and craft vibranium armor and tools
    add all tools and armor
        if fruit not eaten, armor and tools give temporary vibranium decay
    make sure all functionality works in multiplayer
    edit mods.toml and gradle.properties for Mods List page
    organize files and code for final version


Edge Cases:
    there is one case of redundancy in onClonePlayer where setPower() and setHeartColor() are called from
    BlackPantherPowerCapabilities. This is redundant because it sets them to values that they already have


Feature list:
    Burger: hearty food item that can be crafted and eaten to give high hunger and saturation as well as regen and slowness
    Burnt Burger: worse version of burger. has low nutrition and saturation and gives negative effects. can be made by smelting a burger
    Black Panther Fruit: crafted from dormant fruit, this fruit gives the powers of the black panther
