To-Do:
    * Fix BlackPantherPowerCapabilities
        add enhanced jump height to panther power
        fix balancing on attribute modifiers
    Add world gen for Raw Vibranium Block
    add vibranium decay and sickness texture
    make vibranium sickness turn your hunger bar purple
    make vibranium decay turn your hearts black and hunger bar purple
    Finish the Black Panther Fruit
        add texture for unactivated and activated fruit
        unactivated must be crafted with something to make the activated fruit
        fruit makes your hearts purple
    make garden structure where dormant fruit generates (like a dungeon with maybe a boss to get the fruit)
    Add new workstation to process raw vibranium and craft vibranium armor and tools
    add all tools and armor
        if fruit not eaten, armor and tools give temporary vibranium decay
    for any instance where sickness or decay is added, check if player has panther power and give immunity if true
    Add tag descriptions for all items
    make sure all functionality works in multiplayer
    edit mods.toml and gradle.properties for Mods List page
