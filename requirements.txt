To-Do:
    Finish the Raw Vibranium Block (add world generation)
    add vibranium decay and sickness texture
    make vibranium sickness turn your hunger bar purple
    make vibranium decay turn your hearts black (like wither effect)
    Add the Black Panther Fruit (permanently increases strength, speed, jump height, and health.)
        if fruit not eaten, armor and tools gives vibranium decay
        add texture for unactivated and activated fruit
        unactivated must be crafted with something to make the activated fruit
        fruit makes you immune to sickness and decay
        fruit makes your hearts purple
    make garden structure where dormant fruit generates (maybe add a boss here?)
    Add new workstation to process raw vibranium and craft vibranium armor and tools
    add all tools and armor
    make sure all functionality works in multiplayer

    Edge Cases:
        the milk loophole for the vibranium ore beacon effect
